## Japanese Learners Lite

[Demo site](https://lite.japanese-learners.com/)

This repository displays a light-weight Japanese Learning web service built by Svelte-kit. The team worked on this application a couple of hours to investigate the productivity and creativity of Svelte based development.

We prepared the three Japanese quiz sets - beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Users will learn practical Japanese language step by step with fun.

We will start developing the full version of this website followed by the lite version and aim to add a set of rich features such as more quizzes, more categories, and quiz creation pages to allow users themselves to add quizzes.

Moreover, the directions of the app development will be the following;

- Fast: Use frontend component based framework
- Privacy safe: No personal data is needed to use this website
- Data driven: Accumulate action to the big data to improve

## Tech Stacks

- Frontend: Svelte-kit with Bootstrap, TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint Support
- IDE: VSCode
- Build Test: Github ACtions

## Deployment

We recommend container hosting services such as AWS ECS or GCP Cloud Run for hosting this frontend application.
